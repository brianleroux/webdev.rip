  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>Hello, world. I'm <strong>Brian LeRoux</strong>, a Canadian web developer, speaker, AWS Serverless Hero, and co-founder of <a href=https://begin.com>Begin</a>. My career has been a journey through the evolving landscape of technology, marked by a commitment to community, open-source contribution, and the advocacy for web technology. In the early years of the mobile web I was one of the developers behind Apache Cordova (oftimes called PhoneGap). In more recent years I've been obssessed with the potential of serverless to revolutionize how we build and deploy applications, making development more efficient, scalable, and accessible.</p>

  <p>Rooted in the vibrant tech communities of Vancouver, and San Francisco, I've had the privilege of sharing my ocassional breakthroughs and numerous failures at various conferences, inspiring peers and newcomers alike to explore the boundaries of what's possible on the web. My love for tech is exceeded only by my love for the great outdoors. Whether navigating the rugged coastal mountain waters of British Columbia, the warm seas of the southern Gulf Islands, or retreating to the tranquility of the mossy Arbutus bluffs on Vancouver Island, I find balance and inspiration in the raw beauty of nature.</p>

  <p>With <a href=/><b>webdev.rip</b></a>, my aim is to grapple with grim realities of building for the web without succumbing to cynicism or despair. Together we can find reasons to hope, small victories to celebrate, and moments of human connection that light up the darkness that is the advertising fueled corporate web most experience today. The narrative will not shy away from the bleaker aspects, but my aim is to underscore the importance of hope and the human capacity to endure and find meaning even in the darkest times.</p>

  <p>This website is built with HTML, CSS and JS using the <a href=https://enhance.dev>Enhance HTML Framework</a> to server-side render standard web components. Its deployed to AWS with <a href=https://begin.com>Begin</a> using <a href=https://arc.codes>OpenJS Architect</a> under the hood. You can read more about my rationale for constructing this website in the <a href=/notes/first-post>First Postâ„¢</a>.</p>
